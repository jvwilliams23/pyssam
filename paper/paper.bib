@article{ferrarini2007games,
 abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for shape modeling and analysis, rooted in the pattern recognition theory and based on artificial neural networks. Growing and adaptive meshes (GAMEs) are introduced: GAMEs combine the self-organizing networks which grow when require (SONGWR) algorithm and the Kohonenâ€™s self-organizing maps (SOMs) in order to build a mesh representation of a given shape and adapt it to instances of similar shapes. The modeling of a surface is seen as an unsupervised clustering problem, and tackled by using SONGWR (topology-learning phase). The point correspondence between point distribution models is granted by adapting the original model to other instances: the adaptation is seen as a classification task and performed accordingly to SOMs (topology-preserving phase). We thoroughly evaluated our method on challenging synthetic datasets, with different levels of noise and shape variations. Finally, we describe its application to the analysis of a challenging medical dataset. Our method proved to be reproducible, robust to noise, and capable of capturing real variations within and between groups of shapes.},

Reconstruction of the 3D femur shape from two calibrated X-rays with minimal user interaction. 
Combines the benefits of a 3D similarity metric with an automatic edge selection scheme. 
An orientation based correspondence weighting provides robustness w.r.t. noise. 
Robustness w.r.t. the FOV size enables fitting an SSM of the whole femur to knee X-rays, exploiting all information present in the FOV.},
